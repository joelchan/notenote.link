# INST888: Theoretical and Epistemological Foundations in Information Studies

## COURSE DESCRIPTION

Pursuing a doctorate in information studies involves the scholarly examination of the interaction between people, information, technology, and society. There are, however, as many ways to examine the interaction of people, information, technology and society as there are researchers, and many ways of understanding what counts as evidence and knowledge about information in society. 

This doctoral seminar will introduce you to the diverse scholarly traditions that comprise information studies, and will introduce you to how scholarly evidence and knowledge differ between them. It will examine why there are so many ways of knowing and methods of discovery within our field, and help you identify the social theory and methods that will support your path through information scholarship. 

This course is designed to help you find your home among important ideas drawn from various disciplines, which include psychology, library and information science, economics, archives, computer science, sociology, public policy, management, organization studies, history, and anthropology. 

The course has two goals: 
1. to help you map the epistemology of key ideas in information studies – what counts as data, knowledge, and evidence in a given tradition, and why; and 
2. to introduce you to broad research topics of interest in information studies, and how diverse epistemologies are used to investigate those topics. 

The bookends of the course – the first and last module – introduce epistemology. The middle modules of the course help us think through epistemology by introducing broad objects of research interest in information studies.

## Course Objectives

The overall course objectives are for you to:
-   Improve your ability to read, remember, and analyze large bodies of diverse content.   
-   Synthesize concepts, ideas, and literatures foundational to the study of information.
-   Understand the diversity of theoretical and methodological frameworks in information studies and learn to appreciate contributions from scholars and researchers outside your area of interest. 
-   Understand foundational controversies in scientific knowledge creation, including what counts as evidence and who gets to decide.
-   Apply best practices in scholarly communication, including clear and succinct synthesis of prior literature, critical commentary, and compelling presentation of your own ideas. 
-   Create your own epistemological stance by recognizing what counts as data, evidence, and knowledge in your own work.
    
Because we will cover a large number of ideas, the course is a reading-intensive discussion seminar. As the course progresses, you will be expected to compare, contrast and/or synthesize ideas from your prior experience, other courses you have taken, and material discussed earlier in the course. Additionally, we will work to develop creative, constructive, and critical engagement: the ability to identify and imagine how theories and concepts from one area may apply to others.

## COURSE STRUCTURE

The course will be structured around weekly readings and discussions, supplemented by in-class activities and online weekly discussions of readings and issues.

## GRADES AND MAJOR ASSIGNMENTS

Your final grade will be calculated based on the weighting of the following course requirements:
- Attendance and active participation 25%
- Intellectual History and Timeline 20%
- Epistemological Bingo 15%
- Theoretical Framework Essay 25% 
- Theory Family Tree 15%

### Attendance and active participation in class sessions (25% of grade). 

You are expected to participate actively in class discussions, and in asynchronous online discussions, as you are able. 

### Intellectual History (Presentation, 20% of grade): 

With a partner, you will be assigned to one of the weekly topics. (I will ask for preferences and then make assignments). For the week you are assigned, prepare a brief (ballpark 1-3 pages) Google Document outline introducing the history of the scholarship we read. 

Your outline should include discussion of the following aspects of the readings (with relevant links and page numbers):

**Context** 
1.  When were the pieces written, and who were the primary influences on each piece?
2.  Who are the authors? Where did they study, who did they collaborate with, and where did they spend their careers?
3.  How did the education or the position of those scholars influence their arguments?
4.  Whose voices or perspectives have been left out of scholarship in this tradition? 
    
**Epistemology** 

5.  What are the major claims and arguments of these pieces? Where do the pieces/scholars agree, and where do they disagree? 
6.  What evidence do authors use for each of their claims, and how is this influenced by their career trajectories, disciplinary positions, or other factors of their scholarship? 
    
**Points of discussion**

7.  What are three concepts from the readings that you’d like to be sure your classmates learn?    
8.  What are at least three provocative questions you’d like the class to discuss?
    
 I do not care about formatting or polish of content (e.g., bullet points and incomplete sentences are just fine!); I only care that the content is concrete enough (e.g., links, page numbers) to support robust discussion of the week's topics and digging into the epistemological issues. We will work on the Google Doc together during class discussion, and migrate to/from the course notes as appropriate.

Please post a link to the Google Doc to the Weekly Discussion thread by 9 am eastern on Monday of your topic week, so that everyone can view it before the Monday afternoon/evening class session.

### Epistemological Bingo (Credit/no credit, 15% of grade): 

Attend at least **four** talks hosted by the iSchool, elsewhere on campus, or within your broader scholarly community (e.g. virtual conference talks, symposia, etc). You will be assigned a bingo card collaboratively created by iSchool faculty and made up of theories and concepts common in the many disciplines that make up iSchool research. Whenever a guest lecture uses a concept or makes an assumption listed on your card, mark the square, and provide a 2-3 sentence summary of how they used that concept or assumption in their work. Sources of talks include:  

-   HCIL, CASCI, CLIP & DCIC talks
-   Job candidate talks 
-   Dissertation defenses
-   Conference practice talks
-   Dean’s lecture series
-   Conferences and symposia  
    
Talks elsewhere on campus or at conferences are also permitted, although attending talks outside of the iSchool might make it harder to get bingo. 

We will discuss your progress on your bingo cards at class sessions throughout the semester, and scans/photos of the cards with the list of four talks you attended are due on December 13. The first person to bingo will win everlasting fame and bragging rights. 

### Mapping Your Theoretical Framework: Essay (Due December 13. 25% of grade): 

Choose a phenomenon of interest which you might (someday soon) research. Explain your theoretical orientation to this phenomenon in a short essay (2,000-3,000 words). 

Explore:
-   How would you describe your epistemology and theoretical perspectives that you tend to and/or resonate with when considering how you (will) approach researching your phenomenon of interest. Why? 
-   Who are the important scholars working on this phenomenon of interest, and what are the theoretical traditions they draw from?
-   Explain why your framework will support your research goals. Be specific about how your epistemological and theoretical leanings play out in your potential choices (and justification) of methodology and methods.
    
### Theory Family Tree (Due December 13. Credit/no credit, 15% of grade):

The Theory Family Tree is inspired by a visualization created by doctoral student Karen Boyd (you can view that version [here](https://karenleslie.github.io/theory-family-tree/colorcodedbytype.html)). It visualizes a linked dataset that connects social science epistemology, theory, and methods. Like the family tree at the beginning of an epic novel or the title sequence in Game of Thrones, the map is meant to guide and ground a researcher, as well as inspire discussion and expansion. 

Your assignment is to add your own touch to the Theory Family Tree by doing at least one of the following:
-   Connect a method you’re interested in, but not already included, to the map
-   Connect a theoretical perspective you’re interested in, but not already included, to the map: 
-   Flesh out new relationships between at least three existing nodes
-   Add two papers that apply a concept to the theory family tree
    
More detailed instructions forthcoming.

### Grading

All assessment scores will be posted on the course ELMS page.  If you would like to review any of your grades, or have questions about how something was scored, please email me to schedule a time for us to meet and discuss. Final letter grades are assigned based on the percentage of total assessment points earned.  I have to establish clear standards and apply them consistently, so please understand that being close to a cutoff is not the same as making the cut (89.99 ≠ 90.00).  It would be unethical to make exceptions for some and not others. The weighted average of your grades on all of the assignments will be converted to a letter grade according to the following table:

| Weighted Average | Letter Grade |
|--------------------| ------------|
| 97.0 and above | A+ |
| 94.0-96.9 | A |
| 90.0-93.9 | A- |
| 87.0-89.9 | B+ |
| 84.0-86.9 | B |
| 80.0-83.9 | B- |
| 77.0-79.9 | C+ |
| 74.0-76.9 | C |
| 70.0-73.9 | C- |
| 67.0-69.9 | D+ |
| 64.0-66.9 | D |
| 60.0-63.9 | D- |
| Below 60.0 | F |

## COURSE POLICIES:

### Pandemic health and safety. 

Synchronous discussions are a powerful learning resource that can be even better when in-person. We will work hard to preserve our ability to tap into this resource, but also recognize the reality that we are still in a pandemic, albeit the beginning of the end of one. With campus vaccination mandates and appropriate mask mandates tied to transmission guidelines, as well as updated health and safety protocols, it is possible to conduct a ~2.5 hr seminar (with breaks) in person with minimal cumulative risk. See for yourself! That said, it is not unreasonable to predict some disruptions to the ability to join in-person discussions, due to symptom monitoring, precautionary self-isolation/quarantine, and (hopefully not!) infections. We also recognize that risk tolerances vary for many reasons. So we will preserve a Zoom option for all classes, and record all sessions. I will also work with you to figure out reasonable accommodations related to pandemic disruptions.

### Names/Pronouns and Self-Identifications. 
The University of Maryland recognizes the importance of a diverse student body, and we are committed to fostering inclusive and equitable classroom environments. I invite you to tell us how you want to be referred to both in terms of your name and your pronouns (he/him, she/her, they/them, etc.). The pronouns someone indicates are not necessarily indicative of their gender identity. Visit trans.umd.edu to learn more.
Additionally, how you identify in terms of your gender, race, class, sexuality, religion, and dis/ability, among all aspects of your identity, is your choice whether to disclose (e.g., should it come up in classroom conversation about our experiences and perspectives) and should be self-identified, not presumed or imposed.  I will do my best to address and refer to all students accordingly, and I ask you to do the same for all of your fellow Terps.

### Communication with Instructor.
Email: If you need to reach out and communicate with me, please email me at joelchan@umd.edu. Please DO NOT email me with questions that are easily found in the syllabus or on ELMS (i.e. When is this assignment due? How much is it worth? etc.) but please DO reach out as frequently as you like about personal, academic, and intellectual concerns/questions. I will do my best to respond to emails within 24 hours, although any emails sent over the weekend will be answered on Monday.

### ELMS: 
I will send IMPORTANT announcements via ELMS messaging. You must make sure that your email & announcement notifications (including changes in assignments and/or due dates) are enabled in ELMS so you do not miss any messages.  You are responsible for checking your email and Canvas/ELMS inbox with regular frequency.

### Communication with Peers. 
With a diversity of perspectives and experience, we may find ourselves in disagreement and/or debate with one another. As such, it is important that we agree to conduct ourselves in a professional manner and that we work together to foster and preserve a virtual classroom environment in which we can respectfully discuss and deliberate controversial questions. I encourage you to confidently exercise your right to free speech—bearing in mind, of course, that you will be expected to craft and defend arguments that support your position. Keep in mind, that free speech has its limit and this course is NOT the space for hate speech, harassment, and derogatory language. I will make every reasonable attempt to create an atmosphere in which each student feels comfortable voicing their argument without fear of being personally attacked, mocked, demeaned, or devalued. Any behavior (including harassment, sexual harassment, and racially and/or culturally derogatory language) that threatens this atmosphere will not be tolerated. Please alert me immediately if you feel threatened, dismissed, or silenced at any point during our semester together and/or if your engagement in discussion has been in some way hindered by the learning environment.

Citation and Formatting. Use standard professional formatting (double spacing, 1” margins, Times New Roman, 12-point font) for all assignments. For citations, you may use the style guide most appropriate to your area of scholarship, but you must be consistent.  

### Submitting Assignments. 
Each assignment must be submitted before the beginning of class on the indicated due date through our Canvas site (“INST888”). Please include your last name in the file name. 

### Late Work. 
My general policy is that, unless you request an extension from me at least 24 hours in advance of the due date, late work will automatically be graded down by one step for each day that it is late. Assignments more than seven days late will not be accepted. However, we are living through a prolonged pandemic. If you are having trouble submitting assignments on time, please reach out to me: let’s talk about alternatives that will work for you.

### Syllabus Change Policy. 
This syllabus is a guide for the course and is subject to change with advance notice.

## RESOURCES & ACCOMODATIONS

### Accessibility and Disability Services. 
The University of Maryland is committed to creating and maintaining a welcoming and inclusive educational, working, and living environment for people of all abilities. The University of Maryland is also committed to the principle that no qualified individual with a disability shall, on the basis of disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of the University, or be subjected to discrimination. The Accessibility & Disability Service (ADS) provides reasonable accommodations to qualified individuals to provide equal access to services, programs and activities. ADS cannot assist retroactively, so it is generally best to request accommodations several weeks before the semester begins or as soon as a disability becomes known. Any student who needs accommodations should contact me as soon as possible so that I have sufficient time to make arrangements. For assistance in obtaining an accommodation, contact Accessibility and Disability Service at 301-314-7682, or email them at adsfrontdesk@umd.edu. Information about sharing your accommodations with instructors, note taking assistance and more is available from the Counseling Center.

### Student Resources and Services. 
Taking personal responsibility for your own learning means acknowledging when your performance does not match your goals and doing something about it.  I hope you will come talk to me so that I can help you find the right approach to success in this course, and I encourage you to visit UMD’s Student Academic Support Services website to learn more about the wide range of campus resources available to you.
In particular, everyone can use some help sharpening their communication skills (and improving their grade) by visiting UMD’s Writing Center and schedule an appointment with the campus Writing Center. 

You should also know there are a wide range of resources to support you with whatever you might need (UMD’s Student Resources and Services website may help). If you feel it would be helpful to have someone to talk to, visit UMD’s Counseling Center or one of the many other mental health resources on campus.

Basic Needs Security. If you have difficulty affording groceries or accessing sufficient food to eat every day, or lack a safe and stable place to live, please visit UMD’s Division of Student Affairs website for information about resources the campus offers you and let me know if I can help in any way.

### Course Evaluation. 
Please submit a course evaluation through CourseEvalUM in order to help faculty and administrators improve teaching and learning at Maryland. All information submitted to CourseEvalUM is confidential. Campus will notify you when CourseEvalUM is open for you to complete your evaluations for fall semester courses. Please go directly to the Course Eval UM website to complete your evaluations. By completing all of your evaluations each semester, you will have the privilege of accessing through Testudo, the evaluation reports for the thousands of courses for which 70% or more students submitted their evaluations.
