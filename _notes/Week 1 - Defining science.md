## Plan

### 1. Introductions
Names, pronouns, research areas, how you ended up in a doc program

### 2. Discuss [[Syllabus]]
1. Goals
2. Assignments
3. Strategies (including how to read a book!)
4. Questions?

### 3. 15 min break

### 4. Discussion

Opening Q: How do we know a system for knowing is valid? What is one example of a way that knowledge is validated in the intellectual tradition you come from?

#### Readings
- [[Crotty_1998_Chapter 1- Introduction]]
- [[Jaccard_2020_Chapter 3 - Science as an approach to understanding]]
- [[Jaccard_2020_Chapter 12 - Historically Influential Systems of Thought]]
- [[Gaver_2014_Science and Design-The implications of different forms of accountability]]
- [[Henrich et al_2010_The weirdest people in the world]]

#### Discussion questions
- What's a theory? How is it different from a model? Where do theories come from?
- What's the difference between basic vs. applied research? Which do you do?
- How does Crotty (in [[Crotty_1998_Chapter 1- Introduction]]) differentiate methods, methodology, theoretical perspective, and epistemology? What is this distinction useful for?
- What are some examples of epistemology/theories/methodology/methods from your own background/tradition? How do they map to what Jaccard lay out in [[Jaccard_2020_Chapter 12 - Historically Influential Systems of Thought]]? Which of these resonate the most with you?
- Whatâ€™s the difference between science and design? If you wish to do research that intervenes in the world, are you also doing design?
- Have you noticed any tensions between case-specific and generalizable knowledge play out in your areas of interest? How do you decide if something is "research" if it's highly case-specific? How might generalized theories/claims (e.g., "[[Grand Theories]]" of society / human nature) fail to be "research"?

#### Notes from class

Key points: 
- Key contrast between generality and specificity
	- Roughly, this maps to one key point of division between science and design (more contextual)
		- Key bit that makes design not "just engineering" or implementation, is providing enough theorized contextual information to support extrapolation. This is not always present in practitioner-oriented literatures, where emphasis is on hyper-specificity, without support for extrapolation (never mind generalizability)
			- See [[Gaver_2014_Science and Design-The implications of different forms of accountability]] for more details, and contra [[Jaccard_2020_Chapter 3 - Science as an approach to understanding]]'s notions about emphasis on generality as a criterion for theories being "good"
	- See also [[Henrich et al_2010_The weirdest people in the world]]'s key point about the ubiquity of variability in behavioral science: is it even possible to have a science of "human nature"? Is that even useful by core [[Positivism]] standards?
- Key contrast between theory/conceptual and empirical
	- Move towards [[Constructionism]] and away from [[Objectivism]]: might not be possible to "science" if you can't safely assume more direct empirical tests, access to the "real world"
- Four-part lensin [[Crotty_1998_Chapter 1- Introduction]]  as a theory (lens) in the [[Constructionism]] or [[Design]] sense of theory: does it work for you? Less about "is it true".
	- Along similar lines, draw from [[Jaccard_2020_Chapter 12 - Historically Influential Systems of Thought]] less as a way to "LEARN THE THEORIES", and more as a library of lenses to try on as we approach readings
	- Related meta: approach readings as a mercenary, looking to read in the four-part lens, build up your library of lenses and mapping them to the concrete to understand whether/how we can apply them

Other notes:
- Q about design vs. science: is it that design is more iterative and science is slower? [[Joel Chan]] thinks not really: per [[Gaver_2014_Science and Design-The implications of different forms of accountability]], it's more about the basic question of "accountability": is it true (science) vs. does it work (design).
- Crotty and Jaccard balance each other out nicely: Crotty leans in heavily from [[Constructionism]] end, while Jaccard leans in from [[Objectivism]] end. Both do an admirable job of reaching past their comfort zones.
