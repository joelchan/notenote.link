## Plan

### 1. Introductions
Names, pronouns, research areas, how you ended up in a doc program

### 2. Discuss [[Syllabus]]
1. Goals
2. Assignments
3. Strategies (including how to read a book!)
4. Questions?

### 3. 15 min break
If you'd like, take some time to fill out the [intellectual history topics poll](https://umd.instructure.com/courses/1312227/quizzes/1452914?module_item_id=10823989).

### 4. Discussion

Opening Q: How do we know a system for knowing is valid? What is one example of a way that knowledge is validated in the intellectual tradition you come from?

#### Readings
- [[Crotty_1998_Chapter 1- Introduction]]
- [[Jaccard_2020_Chapter 3 - Science as an approach to understanding]]
- [[Jaccard_2020_Chapter 12 - Historically Influential Systems of Thought]]
- [[Gaver_2014 _Science and Design- The implications of different forms of accountability]]
- [[Henrich et al_2010_The weirdest people in the world]]

#### Discussion questions and notes
- What's a theory? How is it different from a model?
	- See [[Jaccard_2020_Chapter 3 - Science as an approach to understanding]], p. 29
- Where do theories come from?
- What's the difference between basic vs. applied research? Which do you do?
- How does Crotty (in [[Crotty_1998_Chapter 1- Introduction]]) differentiate methods, methodology, theoretical perspective, and epistemology? What is this distinction useful for?
- What are some examples of epistemology/theories/methodology/methods from your own background/tradition? How do they map to what Jaccard lay out in [[Jaccard_2020_Chapter 12 - Historically Influential Systems of Thought]]? Which of these resonate the most with you?
- Whatâ€™s the difference between science and design? If you wish to do research that intervenes in the world, are you also doing design?
- Have you noticed any tensions between case-specific and generalizable knowledge play out in your areas of interest? How do you decide if something is "research" if it's highly case-specific? How might generalized theories/claims (e.g., "[[Grand Theories]]" of society / human nature) fail to be "research"?
