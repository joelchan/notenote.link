## Plan

### 0. Announcements / confusions to mark for discussion

#### Announcements
- remember to sign up for slots: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mZlQcboOPglfu_H3jO8EZEx2NjI1H7PUQVsQKA5JNcQ/edit#gid=0

#### Questions/confusions to address

### 1. Flesh out key propositions 

We can think of this week as fleshing out more the main branches and contrasts in [[Crotty_1998_Chapter 1- Introduction]]. 

We don't have time to *test* the claims (although we *do* want to be attentive to justification for claims when we see them). Instead, our goal is to map out more explicitly the lenses we'll want to look out for (at least in broad strokes, on the more leftward columns).

#### 

Drawing on [[Crotty_1998_Chapter 2- Positivism]]: 
- What are central tenets of [[Positivism]]?
- What are some clarifying examples of these tenets? What are some important sources we should bookmark to help us recognize good/bad examples of as we go through the rest of the semester?
- What does positivist qualitative social research look like? How useful is it?

Drawing on [[Crotty_1998_Chapter 3- Constructionism]]:
- What are central tenets of [[Constructionism]]?
- What are some clarifying examples of these tenets? What are some important sources we should bookmark to help us recognize good/bad examples of as we go through the rest of the semester?
- Does it make sense to posit [[Grand Theories]] from the point of view of [[Constructionism]]? Why or why not? If yes, how can this be done well?

Drawing on [[Harding_2009_Standpoint Theories]], and [[Dotson_2015_Inheriting Patricia Hill Collins's Black Feminist epistemology]]:
- What are central tenets of [[Feminist standpoint theory]] and black feminist epistemology?
- Where do we locate them in relation to [[Positivism]] and [[Constructionism]] and [[Subjectivism]]?

Drawing on [[Krohn_2019_Interdisciplinary Cases and Disciplinary Knowledge- Epistemic challenges of Interdisciplinary Research]]:
- How does the distinction between interdisciplinary and disciplinary (aka [[idiographic vs. nomothetic knowledge]]) research relate to the broad distinctions above? Or in discussions we've had?

Concretely, what can we put in our shared understanding?

### 2. Flesh out implications of propositions

Now let's try to connect this more deeply to what we care about: our own research!

Activity: Think-"pair"-share at your tables. 
Try to brainstorm / construct contrasting research proposals from different perspectives. Draw on projects you're working on right now. Bonus points: try to also articulate good/bad examples.

How do these epistemologies relate to each other?
How might they inform how we conduct and judge research?
