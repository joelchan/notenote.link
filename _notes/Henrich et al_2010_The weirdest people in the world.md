## Joel's rough notes
The authors complain that psychologists are trying to aim for universality/generality in a bad way by relying on WEIRD samples. (core argument in 2.2, pp. 63-64)

> despite their narrow samples, behavioral scientists often are interested in drawing inferences about the human mind and human behavior (p.. 63)

> When is it safe to generalize from a narrow sample to the species? First, if one had good empirical reasons to believe that little variability existed across diverse populations in a particular domain, it would be reasonable to tentatively infer universal processes from a single subpopulation. Second, one could make an argument that as long as one’s samples were drawn from near the center of the human distribution, then it would not be overly problematic to generalize across the distribution more broadly – at least the inferred pattern would be in the vicinity of the central tendency of our species. (p. 63)

WEIRD = 
- Western
- Educated
- Industrialized
- Rich
- Democratic

They also helpfully outline a BUNCH of ways that studying people who are not "WEIRD" yields different results than the mainstream "WEIRD" studies:
1. Industrialized vs. small-scale societies vary in terms of:
	- Visual perception
	- Fairness and cooperation in economic decision-making
	- Folkbiological reasoning
	- Spatial cognition
	- *(this point reminds me very much of [[Materialism]]!)*
2. Western vs. non-Western
	- Anti-social punishment and cooperation
	- Independent and interdependent self-concepts
	- Positive self-views
	- Personal choice
	- Motivations to conform
	- Analytic vs. holistic reasoning
	- Moral reasoning
	- *(non-Western is a BIG tent!!!!!!!)*

There's more! But we don't have to dig into the details here. But definitely keep this as a reference in case you catch others (or yourself!!!) saying things like "people do/are X"... which people???

Conclusions:
- Pronounced population variation is commonplace in the behavioral sciences
- WEIRD subjects may often be the worst population from which to make generalizations
- Research topics have been limited by the heavy reliance on WEIRD populations
- Studying children and primates is crucial, but not a replacement for comparative work
- Understanding human diversity is crucial for constructing evolutionary theories of human behavior
	- aha! cc [[Evolutionary perspectives]]
- Exclusive use of WEIRD samples is justified when seeking existential proofs

If you sympathize with [[Constructionism]], this should resonate a LOT, and you might even, together with a design-oriented approach (e.g., [[Gaver_2014_Science and Design-The implications of different forms of accountability]], go even further and say "Why even shoot for generality" at all!?
