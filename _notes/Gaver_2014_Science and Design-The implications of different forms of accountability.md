## Joel's rough notes
Two basic questions (and forms of justification) that relate to "accountability"
- Science: is it **true**? aka "epistemological accountability"
- Design: does it **work**? aka "aesthetic accountability"

The two are often interlinked!
- Cf. [[Kurt Lewin]]'s maxim that "[[CLM - There is nothing so practical as a good theory]]"
	- Lewin, K. (1951). Problems of research in social psychology. In D. Cartwright (Ed.), Field theory in social science: Selected theoretical papers (pp. 155-169). New York: Harper & Row. (p169)
- See also Pasteur's idea of [[Use-inspired Basic Research]], and Ben Shneiderman's idea of Applied and Basic Combined (new ABCs of research) in HCI.

But! The emphasis differs, and the means of accountability differ. This is the crucial pragmatic point.

See also [[Donald Schon]] as an exemplar of a general reaction against the possibility of "design science" (in the strong sense of "science")

Important quote here about design and its relationship to [[Realism]]: 

> The goal of design is to make the world work in new ways by producing new complications, assembling elements in new ways, and crafting them to work together. Design can work with the world as found: it does not have to concern itself with realism in any deep way, nor does it have to get to the bottom of how things really work. It may do so, of course, and often designers are adept at fi nding radical new ways of understanding materials, people and processes in the course of their work. But this is not a requirement for good design, because design is not responsible for explaining the world as it is, but for producing new artefacts that work. (p. 152)

Theory can be very helpful, but it is neither necessary nor sufficient for progress in design. We'll revisit this at various other points this semester, e.g., 
- very directly in [[Halverson_2002_Activity theory and distributed cognition]] from Week 11. 
- And [[Ackerman_2000_The Intellectual Challenge of CSCW]] in Week 8

In a sense, the "aesthetic" criteria identified by (p. 152) Gaver connect with the notions of "generativity" in [[Jaccard_2020_Chapter 3 - Science as an approach to understanding]] as mechanisms for judging theories

> Such designs have individuality : they possess their own character, which is not only original but also integrated and with a clear personality or style. They resonate , reminding and energising and speaking to a wide and potentially incommensurable variety of infl uences, issues, artefacts, phenomena and perspectives, both natural and cultural. They are evocative , stimulating new possibilities for design, whether similar, compatible, extended or even counterbalancing. And perhaps most of all, they are illuminating , reaching out beyond their immediate functionality to suggest new ways to perceive and inhabit the world (p. 152)

Love the concept of [[Productive indiscipline]]!!!

> Design methods often exhibit a productive indiscipline thanks to their freedom from epistemological accountability. That is, design processes are not bound to particular theoretical or methodological rationales, but can borrow from all disciplines or none. Even more subversive, from a scientifi c point of view, all this can be left unclear. Knowing whether something is true or not, whether things have changed or whether a view is idiosyncratic or widely shared may simply not matter when it comes to design. On the contrary, in some cases a lack of knowledge (and meta-knowledge) leads to just the sort of conceptual space in which imagination seems to thrive. We might say that, where science relies on epistemological accountability , design can often work from a kind of epistemological ambiguity  (p. 153)

Another pragmatic implication of this is the emphasis on context and specificity (see pp. 154-156)

Reminds me of a powerful "litany" from [[Jan Van den Akker]]'s book chapter on design approaches and tools in education and training:

> The major knowledge to be gained from development research is in the form of (both substantive and methodological) 'design principles' to support designers in their task. Those principlesa re usually heuristic statements of a format such as "If you want to deign intervention X \[for the purpose/function Y in context Z\], then you are best advised to give that intervention the characteristics A, B, and C \[substantive emphasis\] and to do that via procedures K, L, and M \[procedural emphasis\], because of arugments P, Q, and R." (p. 9)

In a negative sense:
- No replicability
- Limited generality (see p. 160 on "What Designers Know")
	- > Similarly, the understandings achieved through design research are of limited generality, or at least become increasingly dilute the more they are generalised. This contrasts with regularities found in the sciences—such as the law of gravity, for instance, or the 7 ± 2 limit of short term memory, or Fitt’s Law—which remain equally specifi c over a wide range of domains and scales. Because design is a matter of integrating myriad considerations, any given abstraction tends to be situated and contingent, and alters as it is applied to new domains or new scales (c.f. Louridas, 1999 ). Moreover, design is in constant conversation with itself, changing the ground on which it operates, so that many of the approaches that have succeeded in the past will fi nd that their motivating circumstances have changed or simply fallen out of fashion. The result is that design theories tend to be indicative and aspirational, rather than explanatory of stable phenomena. This does not necessarily make them ineffectual, but the “knowledge” they embody is of a different order than scientific knowledge.

An important point about the "container" of knowledge: it's the artefact itself! How useful is an HCI "paper" without access to the artefact itself???
