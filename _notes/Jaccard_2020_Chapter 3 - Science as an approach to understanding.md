## Joel's rough notes

> Given that we have some notion of what should be done, we can evaluate how well what has been done corresponds to what should have been done. The evaluative function permits labeling something as being valid or invalid, reliable or unreliable, or proper or not proper relative to what has been prescribed. (p. 24)

Connects to [[Crotty_1998_Chapter 1- Introduction]]'s notions here and uses langauge of prescriptive functions (or oughts) wrt "what are and are not proper procedures to be followed" (p. 24)

#question How is science different from other ways of knowing?
(this is in a sense the core contention of the chapter, and the core place it interacts with the other readings and broad themes of this semester)

General forms of evaluation:
- Consensual validation - "the worth of a particular conceptualization is gauged by the degree of acceptance it is granted by others." (p. 24)
	- Expert validation (special case of consensual validation) - "decision as to whether a particular conceptualization merits acceptance is determined by selected others who presumably have the knowledge and wisdom to discern what is correct and what is not correct" (p. 24)
- Internal validation - "application of formal rules of logic to examine the concepts and relationships within a particular conceptual system" (p. 25) - sort of connects to rationalist emphasis on deductive reasoning. Common in mathematics and philosophy. Although there is often a question of how to define axioms in the first place!
- Systematic empirical validation - "Over the long run, scientific conceptualizations tend to be accepted only to the extent that they have been subjected to rigorous and systematic empirical testing and shown to be useful" (p. 25)

Jaccard basically argues that science is different (not necessarily better!) by virtue of relying much more heavily on 

Science is in a sense [[Objectivism\|objectivist]] by definition, to the extent that its practitioners assume that there is more or less direct contact with a "real world" against which we can provide trustworthy, independent tests of our conceptual systems (p. 26)

> As Pap (1962) has argued, and Carnap (1936, 1937) and Popper (1963) have concurred, “a scientific statement that claims to say something about the actual world . . . is meaningful if and only if there are possible observations whose outcome is relevant to the truth or falsehood of the statement” (Pap, 1962, p. 24)

This is a contentious problem! It's known as the [[Demarcation problem]] in philosophy of science (see [here](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pseudo-science/)). I'm not aware of a consensus view that it's been solved! [[M. R. Sauter]] is leading an STS seminar this Spring, where they'll look at the work of [[Karl Popper]] and [[Paul Feyerabend]], among others, to dig into this tough problem.

Note! In section on "Science and Objectivity" (starting p. 27), we see v. explicit discussions of the idea that [[Observation is theory-laden]]

> In some respects, science is anything but objective. Whether consciously or not, the scientist brings to any setting a prior schema (or set of thoughts, beliefs, and assumptions) that is used to filter, interpret, and analyze the world about him or her. This is an inevitable feature of human nature and human thinking. The scientist’s schema and values influence the selection and formulation of problems the scientist decides to study, the types of strategies the scientist uses to collect data (since such acts ultimately are determined by how a problem is formulated), and how data are interpreted so as to alter or strengthen the scientist’s initial conceptualization. (p. 27)

#question What is a theory?

Good quotes:
- "A theory is a symbolic construction" (Kaplan, 1964)
- "...a set of statements or sentence" (Simon & Newell, 1956)
- "...one or more functional statements or propositions that treat the relationship of variables so as to account for a phenomenon or set of phenomena" (Hollander, 1967)

Jaccard defines theory intuitively as "set of statements about the relationship(s) between two or more concepts or constructs"

I think this is... fine.

#question Models vs. theories?

eh, depends. my own disciplinary take is that models tend to actually be more "general", whereas in psych, theories are models that try to *explain*, not just predict (see [[Iris van Rooij]])

#question What makes for a good theory?

> In sum, good theories, in principle, (1) increase our understanding of the world, (2) are accepted by the broader scientific community (but see Box 3.1), (3) are logically consistent, (4) are in agreement with known data and facts, (5) are testable, (6) are easily understood and communicated to others, (7) are appropriately parsimonious, (8) are consistent with other accepted theories that have achieved consensus (but see Box 3.1), (9) are relatively broad in scope, (10) are novel and original, and (11) stimulate research (p. 33)

Note! Jaccard quote a statement from Shaw and Costanzo about generality as a core tenet of a good theory:
> Other things being equal, the greater the range of the theory (i.e., the more of “reality” that it encompasses), the better it may be

Here we connect directly back to [[Henrich et al_2010_The weirdest people in the world]], who aren't necessarily pushing back against universal human nature theories, but are certainly giving some fodder in that direction! And in a sense, [[Constructionism]], as we will see, has asumptions in it that make very general statements and theories less likely/useful, since construction is local!

The discussion of utility also I think raises a question about tensions between specificity and generality: in design, specificity is often very useful, and is often a site for serious theory-practice gaps (too abstract!)

In general I'm leery of broad prescriptive statements from this. Although! It might be useful to know where your audience is coming from to understand what criteria they are using to judge! Can lean into the "other things being equal"

Love the section on "Ways of Making a Theoretical Contribution" (starting p. 37) - super practical. Bookmark for later.

The alert reader should notice key omissions in the suggested readings: [[Karl Popper]] and [[Imre Lakatos]], but no [[Bruno Latour]] ([[Constructionism]]) or [[Paul Feyerabend]] (anarchist) :)
