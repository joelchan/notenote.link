## Joel's rough notes
The chapter is trying to lay out the motivation for a four-part way of thinking about the research process. It's grounded, roughly, in the "methods" section of a research proposal or paper - basically, this is "how we know" (see p. 2):
- > "...First, what methodologies and methods will we be employing in the research we propose to do?"
	- Basically: this is how we're going to try to answer our question
- > "...Second, how do we justify this choice and use of methodologies and methods?"
	- Basically: this is why that makes sense and you can "buy" the answers we're going to get

These two questions expand into four components, which are broadly defined on p. 3:
1. [[Method]]: 
	- > "techniques or procedures used to gather and analyse data related to some research question or hypothesis" [[Crotty_1998_Chapter 1- Introduction]] 
2. [[Methodology]]: 
	- > "strategy, plan of action, process or design lying behind the choice and use of particular methods and linking the choice and use of methods to the desired outcomes"
3. [[Theoretical perspective]]:
	- > "the philosophical stance informing the methodology and thus providing a context for the process and grounding its logic and criteria."
		- I believe this is the most direct bridge to [[Ontology]]: 
			- > Were we to introduce it into our framework, it would sit alongside epistemology informing the theoretical perspective, for each theoretical perspective embodies a certain way of understanding what is (ontology) as well as a certain way of understanding what it means to know (epistemology). (p. 10)
4. [[Epistemology]]:
	- > "the theory of knowledge embedded in the theoretical perspective and thereby in the methodology"

My guess is that 1 and 2 are more present in the texts, and 3 and 4 are often absent, except in very good papers, or in papers in interdisciplinary outlets where reviewers may be heterogenous in their disciplinary orientations.

#question - why is it useful to distinguish these elements?
some thoughts:
- know that/when you can/should "dig deeper" when you come up against a puzzle (e.g., question your theoretical perspective or epistemology), e.g., when your methods aren't yielding useful results
- get a better handle of the space of options available to you (if flat list, can be overwhelming to wrangle)
- find your place in scholarly discussions, focus discussions in more useful/productive ways (ah, you are not happy with this method choice, but where the disagreement really is in our epistemology; let's talk about that first)
- more general point: to drive home the point that [[Observation is theory-laden]]
- also, cf. pp. 15-18, a better insight into the "great divide" beyond quant and qual (v possible to do qual research in a [[Positivism\|positivist]] fashion! I actually did this in grad school; one hint is inter-rater reliability and statistics being used. And many deeply [[Constructionism\|constructionist]] papers still report general quantified trends to inform judgments of spread/support)

#question - what is the difference between methodology and methods?
- noticed that some of the quant/positivist stuff in the examples here are... sort of high level even at the methods level? that's ok. reflects the author's background.
- key bit I think is **rationale** - maybe the bridge between [[Method]] and [[Theoretical perspective]] and [[Epistemology]] - concretely, it's most of the justification (not descriptive) text in the methods section. the why, not the how. which will draw on theories and epistemology as appropriate, but may also have some pragmatic considerations like "this estimator performs poorly when the data are not in this particular distribution, so we " or "for feasibility reasons, we stopped our data collection at X interviewees; this is ok for our purposes bc we also reached saturation"

Note on the relationship between the elements (see pp. 12-18): lots of freedom!
