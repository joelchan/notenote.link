## Joel's rough notes
Put less thought into the latter portions bc they are a bit more specific.

#### Grand theories
- [[Materialism]] - broadly, "economic issues are central to explaining the structure and function of society"
	- (i think the name is unfortunate!)
	- examples:
		- [[Karl Marx]]
		- [[Friedrich Engels]]
		- [[Sidney Mintz]]
			- > Sidney Mintz (1986) conducted a thorough study of sugar production in the Caribbean and highlighted the ways in which the introduction of this commodity changed world economic relations, generated new forms of labor, augmented the slave trade, and completely transformed Caribbean economies. The newly acquired tastes of the English ruling elites for sugar led to global needs for sugar and contributed to a forceful new dynamic in the world economy. In the typical form of a materialist, Mintz focused on history, power relations, and the economy to provide a complex and integrated analysis of social, cultural, and economic processes surrounding sugar production. (p. 342)
		- [[June Nash]]
			- > June Nash (1989), in her book From Tank Town to High Tech: The Clash of Community and Industrial Cycles, studied deindustrialization in the northeastern United States, documenting the impact on a town of the closing of a General Electric plant that built products for the military. She showed how the changes associated with the closure paralleled changes in the country and in the world more broadly and how these macrolevel changes could be used to make sense of the local developments. Her analyses emphasized economic dynamics at the local, national, and world levels and their impact on the lives of individuals.  (p. 342)
- [[Structuralism]] - sort of an approach? assume there is some deeper structure to uncover (might be unconscious!), and it's helpful to do some kind of binary/dialetic
	- examples:
		- [[Claude Levi-Strauss]]
		- [[Noam Chomsky]]'s approach to linguistics - theory of transformational-generative grammar
- [[Functionalism]] - 1) societal components are *functional*, and 2) comprise a system of interdependent parts that tend toward equilibrium
	- Examples:
		- [[Merton]] - latent and manifest functions (this was referenced recently by [[Zeynep Tufecki]] in [analysis](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/09/pandemic-no-excuse-colleges-surveil-students/616015/) of educational institutions from a sociological perspective, and how this should inform pandemic policy)
			- > One of the most important latent functions of higher education in the United States is to provide a place for socialization where young adults can meet their potential lifelong friends, spouses, and business partners, and where they can create their durable social networks. Another is to provide a quasi-supervised transition from parental control to responsible, fully independent adulthood. That comes with the basic understanding that students will socialize and, yes, party, and that’s why colleges trying to recruit students emphasize the quality of life and extracurriculars they provide: the meal plans, the climbing gyms, the social clubs. Plus, many colleges are home to fraternities and sororities, which supercharge some of higher education’s latent functions, providing members with more exclusivity and less supervision, but still under the umbrella of the university. To deny these latent functions is to deny why residential higher education exists. Certainly, it’s for the learning and the experience in the classrooms and labs, but it's not just for that. Making the latent functions explicit is important because we have to account for them in how we manage and change these institutions—during regular times and during a crisis. For example, for K–12 education, “[summer learning loss](https://www.brookings.edu/research/summer-learning-loss-what-is-it-and-what-can-we-do-about-it/)” is a well-documented consequence of ignoring its latent function of child care. During the summer, when families lose the child care that school provides, those with resources can make up for the loss in ways that not only keep their children occupied, but also continue their education. Many times, kids from better-off families return to school in the fall after having attended enriching summer camps, whereas poorer families have to make do with haphazard child care—often the TV, and these days probably a lot of YouTube. This has implications during the pandemic as well, because wealthier families can respond to K–12 school closures by hiring tutors and forming pods, while poorer kids [struggle even to access Wi-Fi](https://www.ksbw.com/article/photo-showing-2-salinas-girls-doing-homework-outside-taco-bell-goes-viral/33834659). In the case of higher education, pretending that the latent function of socializing doesn’t exist makes controlling the pandemic harder.
		- [[Katz]] functionalist theory of attitudes
	- Latter assertion about equilibrium is in dispute
- [[Symbolic interactionism]] asserts 1) people act toward things based on the meanings of those things to them, 2) meanings of objects emerge socially through our interactions with others, and 3) meaning is the result of an interpretive process used by people to deal with the stimuli they encounter
	- Often informs [[Grounded theory]]
	- [[Herbert Blumer]] recommends exploratory analysis, [[Participant observation]], and intensive [[Case studies]] as pre-theory building
	- Examples:
		- [[Herbert Blumer]] 
- [[Evolutionary perspectives]] emphasize 1) adaptation (how a behavior functions historically to increase survival and/or reproduction of species), 2) ultimate causation, and 3) individualism (selection works mainly at level of individual; social institutions emerge from selection at the individual level)
	- In a sense is similar to [[Functionalism]], but with less of an emphasis on equilibrium, and more of a specific historical view of function (not present, but prehistoric, and in terms of survival and reproduction specifically)
- [[Postmodernism]]
	- I'm not super familiar with this from my upbringing, but I'm becoming moreso.
	- Examples:
		- [[Jacques Derrida]]

#### Metaphors

- Neural networks - i'll mentally translate this to [[Network Analysis]]
- [[Systems Theory]]. Key concepts include notions of [[Feedback loops]] and [[Equilibrium]]
	- Connects to [[Functionalism]]?

Should add general information-processing and computation as a model!

And dynamical systems as an instance of [[Systems Theory]]

#### Process-based analyses of change

- [[Life cycle model]]
	- Subclass: [[Stage theories of change]]
- [[Teleological model]]
	- Connects to [[Systems Theory]]
- [[Dialectical model]]
	- Connects to [[Structuralism]]
- [[Evolutionary model]]
	- Connects to [[Evolutionary perspectives]]

#question  is it possible to "science" these theories? how can grand theories be subjected to empirical test, as [[Jaccard_2020_Chapter 3 - Science as an approach to understanding]] outline as the core tenet of science?

#### Psychological frameworks

- [[Reinforcement theories]] emphasis concepts of [[Stimulus and Response]]
- [[Humanism]] and [[Positive psychology]]
	- Example [[Carl Rogers]]' "client-centered therapy"

#### Methodology

- Multilevel modeling
- Person-centered or cluster-oriented modeling
