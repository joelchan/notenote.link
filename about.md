Welcome to the course notes for INST888 (Theoretical and Epistemological Foundations in Information Studies)!

As the semester progresses, we will add weekly discussion notes, concepts, and reading notes.

Note: this is a hypertext notebook, so if you're not used to navigating hypertext media (although Wikipedia is a good first point of reference), [this article](https://www.whoi.edu/science/B/people/kamaral/hypertext.html) might be useful background.
